# WeatherApp
Creating a Weather Application!


In this challenge I was assigned with the task of creating a weather app. When you input a city name you should get the weather for that area. However, I ran out of time this week with both the project and challenge to work on. My website shows a simple weather card with an icon to display current weather condition, temperature, humidity and wind speed. Although there is no data being displayed on my webpage at the moment, there is data being displayed in the console that gives you current weather conditions for a small town in Italy.

# Update:

## I went back to this challenge and was able to connect API data to my webpage so information is viewed! Now when you search for a city accurate weather data will appear!
